# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects

This repository contains my coding projects and assignments for the **C# and .NET Framework - Part 1** course.  
Each project demonstrates different C# programming concepts such as data types, object-oriented programming, branching, loops, Boolean logic, and more.  

These projects are part of my learning journey with the Academy of Learning Career College and will serve as the foundation of my online portfolio.
